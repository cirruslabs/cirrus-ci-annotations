# Cirrus CI Annotations Parser

[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-annotations.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-annotations)

This module helps Cirrus CI to parse artifacts and find relative annotations to report in GitHub UI.

# Cirrus Annotation Format

For tools that don't yet have their own annotation format, or for those that are wishing to simplify the integration process (to avoid adding a new parser), there's a simple streamed format they can use.

All you need to do is to emit JSON objects, [one per line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Line-delimited_JSON), where each describes a repository's file and what's gone wrong with it.

Here's an example:

```json
{"level": "warning", "message": "use of os.SEEK_START is deprecated", "path": "main.go", "start_line": 35, "end_line": 35}
{"level": "failure", "message": "TestMain() failed!", "raw_details":  "main_test.go:18: expected a non-nil return", "path": "main_test.go", "start_line": 18, "end_line": 18}
```

Required fields:

* `level` â€” describes the severity of the annotation and results in different web UI rendering and build failure behavior
  * can be either `notice`, `warning` or `failure`
* `message` â€” a short description of what's gone wrong
* `path` â€” points to a file with the issue, relative to the repository's root
* `start_line` and `end_line` â€” the range of lines in `path` where the issue has happened
  * if your tool can only generate the information about a single line â€” simply set them both to that value

Optional fields:

* `raw_details` â€” an extension to the `message` that will be rendered as code and thus can contain multiple lines
* `start_column` and `end_column` â€” used to specify a more precise range than just using `start_line` and `end_line`
